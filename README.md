# Space Missions Analysis

This project involves the analysis of space missions data, aiming to gain insights into various aspects of space exploration, including launch trends, success rates, and more. The analysis is performed using Python programming and relevant libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and plotly.

## Project Overview

### Objective

The primary objective of this project is to analyze space missions data to understand trends and patterns in space exploration. This includes:

- Analyzing the number of launches per year.
- Identifying the countries and organizations with the most space missions.
- Exploring mission success rates.
- Visualizing the data using charts and graphs.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine.

2. **Install Dependencies**: If you are using a local Jupyter Notebook setup, install the required Python libraries using pip. However, when using Google Colab or similar, dependencies can be installed directly within the notebook.

3. **Explore the Data**: The dataset (mission_launches) is provided in a CSV format. You can explore and manipulate the data using Python and pandas.

4. **Run the Analysis**: Execute Python scripts or code cells in your notebook to perform the analysis and generate visualizations.

5. **Review Results**: Analyze the results and gain insights into space missions trends and patterns.

6. **Share and Collaborate**: If you are using Google Colab, you can share your notebook with others and collaborate in real-time.

## Additional Features

- **Sunburst Charts**: Utilizes sunburst charts to visualize data related to countries, organizations, and mission statuses.

- **Choropleth Maps**: Uses Plotly choropleth maps to display launches by country with the help of the ISO3166 module.

- **Pie Chart Comparison**: Includes a pie chart comparing space missions between the USSR and the US during the Cold War.
